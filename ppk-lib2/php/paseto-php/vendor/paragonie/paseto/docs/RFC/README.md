# RFC Drafts

This directory is for the development of a proposed Internet Standard by the

However, PASETO's completion is not contingent upon IETF acceptance. For an
example of a de facto standard that exists without standards bodies' blessing,
see: [the Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol).
